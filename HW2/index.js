// EXTRA CREDIT:
// Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:
  // E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
// If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?
// Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component
